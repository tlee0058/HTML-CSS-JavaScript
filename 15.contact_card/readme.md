Contact Card
Note: Upload your work in GitHub and allow your collaborators to add/suggest new features for your work.

You are going to design a contact card page. The user should be able to input contacts to the page. Using the techniques demonstrated in the videos, you must use jQuery to append new data to the page and make the content interactive. Remember, the content you are making is dynamic, so be sure to attach your handlers appropriately.

NOTE: we recommend using $(document).on("click", ".btn") for this assignment as opposed to $(".btn").click()
