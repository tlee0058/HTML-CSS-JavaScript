If You Don't Mind, Can I Have The Time?
Create a program that will tell you the time.

With the following variables...

var HOUR = 8;
var MINUTE = 50;
var PERIOD = "AM";
...your program should print "It's almost 9 in the morning"

And when changed to...

var HOUR = 7;
var MINUTE = 15;
var PERIOD = "PM";
...your program should print "It's just after 7 in the evening"

Challenge:
If minutes less than 30, "just after" the hour, more than 30, "almost" the next hour
AM / PM, "in the morning", "in the evening",
HINT

You can add as many items into console.log as you need (They will be separated by spaces)

Example:

var person = "Jack";
var me = "Jill";
console.log("Hello", person, "I am ", me, ".");
// Hello Jack I am Jill.
Bonus (Only If You Have Time):
Add functionality for "quarter after", "half past", "5 after" ...
Distinguish between "in the afternoon", "at night", "noon", "midnight" ...
